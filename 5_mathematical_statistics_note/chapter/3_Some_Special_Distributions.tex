\begin{exercise}{3.2.17}{}
    Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be two independent random variables.
    Suppose that $X_1$ and $Y=X_1+X_2$ have Possion Distributions
    with means $\mu_1$ and $\mu>\mu_1$, respectively.
    Find the distribution of $X_2$.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}{3.4.21}{}
    Let $f(x)$ and $F(x)$ be the pdf and the cdf, respectively, of a distribution of 
    the continuous type such that $f'(x)$ exists for all $x$. Let the mean of the truncated distribution
    that has pdf $g(y)=f(y)/F(b)$, $-\infty<y<b$, zero elsewhere, be equal to $-f(b)/F(b)$ for all real $b$.
    Prove that $f(x)$ is a pdf of a standard normal distribution.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}{3.5.9}{}
    Say the correlation coefficient between the heights of husbands and wives is 
    $0.70$ and the mean male height is $5$ feet $10$ inches with standard deviation $2$ inches,
    and the mean female height is $5$ feet $4$ inches with standard deviation $1\frac{1}{2}$ inches.
    Assuming a bivariate normal distribution, what is the best guess of the height of 
    a woman whose husband's height is $6$ feet? Find a $95\%$ prediction interval for her height.
\end{exercise}
