\chapter{Optimality conditions for unconstrained problems}

The definitions of global and local solutions of optimization problems are intuitive, 
but usually impossible to check directly. 
Hence, we will derive easily verifiable conditions that are either
necessary for a point to be a local minimizer (thus helping us to identify candidates for minimizers),
or sufficient (thus allowing us to confirm that the point being considered is a local minimizer), or,
sometimes, both.

\section{ Optimality conditions: the necessary and the sufficient}


\begin{align*}
    (\text{P})\quad \min_{\vect{x}} f(\vect{x})\\
    s.t.\  \vect{x}\in X,
\end{align*}
where $\vect{x}=(x_1,\dots,x_n)^T\in\R^n$, $f(x):\R^n\rightarrow\R$, and $X$ is an open set (usually $X=\R^n$).

Necessary condition for local optimality: "if $\overline{x}$ is a local minimizer of (P), 
then $\overline{x}$ must satisfy\dots"
Such conditions help us identify all candidates for local optimizers.

\begin{theorem}{}{}
    Suppose that $f$ is differentiable at $\overline{x}$. If there is a vector
